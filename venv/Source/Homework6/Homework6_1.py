# Problem 5.1

# For the initial value problem:

#       y` = (y**2)*sin(t), y(0) = −3

# which has the exact solution:

#       y(t) = 3/(3*cos(t) − 4)

# a) Approximate by hand y(π/2), using Euler’s method with n = 2 steps.
# b) Approximate by hand y(π/2), using the Taylor’s Method with n = 2 steps.
# c) Approximate by hand y(π/2), using the Modified Euler method with n = 2
# steps.
# d) Compare the errors from the different methods at t = π/2. Use the percentage
# error:

#       Percentage Error = abs((estimate - exact) / exact) * 100)
